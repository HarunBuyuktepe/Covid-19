# Covid-19
In this project, we examined the RNA structure of the corona virus, which is the main actor of a current event that critically affects the world. In this assignment, we compute RNA k-mers of two specific instance of corona vir√ºs. Furthermore, we examine same repetition of k-mers for these two instance, also we generate reverse complement of these two RNAs.
